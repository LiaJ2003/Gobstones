Buggy implementations:

1. there's a problem with marble confirmation; even after confirming can still
move. this may be due to the bounds checking not working, will need to check math
2. marbles move on their own randomly sometimes
    - this may be due to loops being our primary method of checking
    - should re-integrate our marbles into dictionaries and sort between the
    current playing marble and the not-in-play marbles
    - NOTE: please do this OUTSIDE of the shared directory as to make it easier
    to backtrack
